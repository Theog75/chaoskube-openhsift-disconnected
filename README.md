## What is chaoskube?

[Chaoskube](https://github.com/linki/chaoskube) is a piece of software designed to test you application/enrvionment runniing on Kubernetes for recovery from failures.

The basics of chaos engineering is to deliberately inject failures and misconfigurations into an applications or an environment to test for resilience in turbulent conditions, thus finding the places in code or configuration that require attention in case of instability and making them as resilient as possible to failures.
